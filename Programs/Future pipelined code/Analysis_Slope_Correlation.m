% Goal: To have correlation between slope of the delta power of the invalid
% trial vs delta solpe (valid - invalid).
% Objective:  is to plot solpes of the invlaid on the x axis
% and delta slope (valid - invalid) on the y axis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1st : calculate the solpe
% 2nd way: linear fit
